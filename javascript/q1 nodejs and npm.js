// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
//  It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, which means
//  that you can use JavaScript to write server-side code. Node.js is built 
// for high-performance, non-blocking I/O operations, making it an ideal choice
//  for building scalable, data-intensive, real-time applications.

// NPM(Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that makes it 
// easy to install and manage third - party libraries and modules for your Node.js 
// applications.It is the default package manager for Node.js and is included with
//  every Node.js installation.NPM enables you to easily share your own code or 
// use code created by others, which can help you to save time and effort when 
// developing your application.

//     Node.js and NPM are different from common Java because while Java is a general
//  - purpose programming language, Node.js is specifically built for server 
// - side development, and NPM is a package manager that is designed to work with Node.js.

// For web developers, Node.js is a valuable skill to have because it allows you 
// to write both client - side and server - side code in JavaScript, which can make
//  the development process more efficient and streamlined.Additionally,
//  Node.js is widely used in the industry for building web applications and real 
// - time systems, and many popular web development tools, 
// such as Angular, React, and Vue.js, use Node.js as a runtime environment.

//     Moreover, NPM makes it easy to use and share libraries and modules,
//  which can help you to write more efficient and maintainable code.
// This can save you a lot of time and effort as you donâ€™t have to reinvent
//  the wheel every time you need a specific functionality.

// In short, learning Node.js and NPM can help you to become a more versatile 
// and efficient web developer, and can open up new opportunities for you in the industry.
