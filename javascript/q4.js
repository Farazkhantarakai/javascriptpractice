// A component-based web application is different from other web applications in terms 
// of its structure and design. In a component-based web application, the user interface 
// is built using reusable components, each of which is responsible for rendering a 
// specific part of the UI. This makes the code more modular, organized, and reusable, 
// and allows developers to manage the application's UI more easily.

// Shadow DOM, also known as virtual DOM, is a feature of modern web browsers that enables
//  web developers to create and use their own custom elements. Shadow DOM isolates the 
// internal structure, style, and behavior of a component from the rest of the document,
//  which means that a component's styles and scripts are encapsulated and don't affect 
// the rest of the page.

// In React, state and props are two important concepts that are used to manage and pass 
// data between components.

// State refers to the internal state of a component, which is private to that component 
// and can change over time in response to user actions or other events. For example, a 
// toggle component might have a state that keeps track of whether it's turned on or off.

// Props, on the other hand, are used to pass data from a parent component to its child
//  components. Props are read-only and cannot be changed by the child component. 
// This means that the child component receives data from its parent, but cannot modify it.

// In React, the virtual DOM helps to optimize the process of updating the UI. 
// When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM, which is a 
// lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It then compares the virtual
//  DOM with the previous version of the virtual DOM to determine the minimum number of 
// changes that need to be made to the actual DOM. This helps to improve the performance
//  of React applications, as it minimizes the number of DOM updates that need to be made.

// Overall, the component-based architecture, the virtual DOM, and the use of state and
//  props make React a powerful framework for building modern web applications that are 
// fast, scalable, and easy to maintain.
